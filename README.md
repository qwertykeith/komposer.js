# Komposer

## Huh?

Komposer is an experimental music/beat making app.  The aim is to eventually be able to make relatively interesting music without much effort.

Roll your mouse around the screen and trigger loops. Currently the best experience is via a mouse or trackpad, better touch experience coming soon hopefully.

Click and drag to move the loops around to organise your instrument.

The loops are just randomly generated from a limited pool of sounds.  The color of each loop represents the sound and the size represents to speed at which the sound is playing.  

The "auto" mode is in very early days, so not very usable right now
